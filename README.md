This repository demonstrates a potential pitfall when using Ruby's `method_missing` method.  The `bug.rb` file contains code that uses `method_missing` to handle method calls that don't explicitly exist, effectively suppressing the expected `NoMethodError`. This can be problematic because it hides potential errors, leading to difficult-to-debug problems. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.rb`, explains ways to address this issue.
